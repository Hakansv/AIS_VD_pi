== 1. What and Why


AIS-VD is a tool for the AIS class A transponder to upload static voyage data. +
When installed and activated the plugin will be a part of the OpenCPN option tools. +
The tool is located in Options > Ships > AIS Voyage data.

You can select a Navigational status from the list.

Next destination can be typed in the text box.

When used by the button "Send to AIS" it will be formatted to capitals and copied to the selection list +
if not already present.

Maximum 15 used destinations will be saved in the list box. +
A destination selected from the list box will be moved to up in list if not already there. +
Thus will the least used destination be sorted out if more than 15 in the list.

According to NMEA0183 standard the ETA date and time shall be given as UTC and not local time.

When you are satisfied push the "Send to AIS" button and the NMEA setence ECVSD will be +
sent to every connection set up as an "Output". 
(It can be wise to add a "Output filter" to the connection: Transmitt sentences: ECVSD )

After having used the "Send to AIS" button the NMEA0183 VSD message is collected from the data stream flowing trough OCPN multiplexer and printed as the button text.
The plugins have no API to OCPN messaging if there are any output connections established or not.
Neither are no AIS devices we have seen communicating any receiving receipt message.
All together we don't know if the message is received or not. The user is therefore requested to check on the AIS device itself.
