if not already present.

Maximum 15 used destinations will be saved in the list box. +
A destination selected from the list box will be moved to up in list if not already there. +
Thus will the least used destination be sorted out if more than 15 in the list.

According to NMEA0183 standard the ETA date and time shall be given as UTC and not local time.

When you are satisfied push the "Send to AIS" button and the NMEA setence ECVSD will be +
sent to every connection set up as an "Output".
